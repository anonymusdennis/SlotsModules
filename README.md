# SlotsModules

soothe your gambling addiction without losing any real money

- modularised
- and with a settings file which can be modified by an (imaginary) end-user
- change the amount of slots you play with
    - min = 2
    - max = 7
- with Classes or OOP or whatever
- spin animations!
- recursion!

This is a school project I'm working on

Inspired by t!slots from https://tatsu.gg
