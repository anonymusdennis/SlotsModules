# SlotsModules

soothe your gambling addiction without losing any real money

 - modularised
 - and with a settings file which can be modified by an (imaginary) end-user
 - change the amount of slots you play with
   - min: 2
   - max: 7
 - with Classes or OOP or whatever
 - Animations!

This is a school project I'm working on

- inspired by t!slots from https://tatsu.gg
